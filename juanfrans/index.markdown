Hi! I'm Juan Francisco Saldarriaga. I am a researcher at the [Brown Institute for Media Innovation](https://brown.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University.

I work at the intersection of data, GIS, visualization, journalism, architecture, urbanism, and the humanities, and I teach graduate level [workshops and seminars](https://github.com/juanfrans-courses) on mapping, advanced GIS and data visualization. In the past I've worked as a research scholar at the [Center for Spatial Research](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/) and the [Spatial Information Design Lab](http://spatialinformationdesignlab.org/), as an architectural designer for [Carlos Zapata Studio](https://www.cz-studio.com/) and D.G.T. Architects, and as the GIS project coordinator for the [Catholic Charities of New York](https://catholiccharitiesny.org/). I also have a degree in philosophy...

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juanfrans) and on [Github](https://github.com/juanfrans). Or email me [here](mailto:juanfrans@gmail.com).

These are some of my projects. In time, more will be added.
