*This project was developed at the [Spatial Information Design Lab](http://spatialinformationdesignlab.org/) in collaboration with Thomson Reuters Research Unit. Its team included Laura Kurgan, Juan Francisco Saldarriaga, Annelie Berner, and Jen Lowe.*

Using D3 as an interactive web platform we designed a map interface that is scaled globally while embedded with local stories about energy movement from port to port. Data can be viewed across time, which reveal changes in patterns of movement as the geopolitics, price of oil, and conditions at specific ports change.

This detailed view of Mott Haven and Port Morris shows each environmental and demographic metric at a more detailed scale. In addition, you can see how implementing the Randall's Island Connector - an NYCEDC project - will change the distance to open spaces metric for the neighborhood.
