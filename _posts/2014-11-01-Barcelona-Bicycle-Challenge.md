During the two months of the *Barcelona Cycle Challenge 2014* thousands of bicycle rides were taken around the city. To visualize all of this activity, we created an animation mapping out the routes that people take and tallying up the number of kilometers ridden by each of the participating neighborhoods. To give a better idea of the commuting patterns of bike riders in Barcelona, this animation compresses all the rides into a single day.

This project was done in collaboration with *Play To Ride* and was programmed using <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>.
