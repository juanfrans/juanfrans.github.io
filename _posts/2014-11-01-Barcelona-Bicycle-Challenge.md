During the two months of the *Barcelona Cycle Challenge 2014* thousands of bicycle rides (???) were taken around the city. To visualize all of this activity, we created this animation mapping out the routes that people take and tallying up the number of kilometers ridden by each of the participating neighborhoods. We also compressed all the rides into a single day, giving a better idea of the commuting patterns of Barcelona bicycle riders.

This project was done in collaboration with <a href="?????">Play To Ride</a> (??? insert link here) and was programmed using <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> (??? verify this link).
