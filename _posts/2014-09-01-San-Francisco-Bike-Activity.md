Revisiting a previous project of ours. In collaboration with Natasa Papadi.

This visualization analyzes the 20 most popular bike sharing stations in San Francisco in four different areas, and in doing so, it creates a more detailed, nuanced and complex image of the Bay Area Bike Share System.

The diagrams are based on the traditional pie chart, but they vary and evolve to better represent each station's attributes. Two systems of information interact here in order to outline each station's unique profile and deliver insights: one station popularity network and one based on usage frequency and customer type.
