Understanding how the largest technology companies collect, use, and share user information across the internet. We’ve transformed the “Big Four” terms of service and data policies -- the thousands of lines of code that govern their use of your data -- into a database powering an interactive visualization, an initial version of which we invite you to explore and critique.

*Mapping Data Flows was built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).*
