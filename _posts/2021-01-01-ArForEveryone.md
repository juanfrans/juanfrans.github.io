*AR For Everyone! was produced at [The Brown Institute for Media Innovation](https://brown.columbia.edu/) with support from an [ONA's Journalism 360 grant](https://journalists.org/programs/journalism-360/challenge/2020-winners/). Its team was Ziv Schneider, Juan Francisco Saldarriaga, and Sukanya Aneja.*

As part of the [AR For Everyone! project](https://browninstitute.github.io/ar-for-everyone/) we built a story map analyzing and visualizing the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses in New York State and New York City. For our base dataset we scraped New York State's [Worker Adjustment and Retaining Notification database](https://dol.ny.gov/warn-notices) and we analyzed it using Python. Using Mapbox's [storytelling template](https://browninstitute.github.io/ar-for-everyone/), we then created this walk through taking the viewer from the state level, to New York City, to a specific section of Midtown Manhattan, and then letting them explore its 3D model in augmented reality.

Here are some screenshots from the story:
