For years, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was understood as a regional phenomenon that mainly affected ocean temperatures and precipitation. But in recent decades, scientists have discovered diverse and far-reaching effects of ENSO on everything from mudslides in Africa to the military history of Europe. El Niño causes many of Earth's most drastic variations in weather, temperature, and rainfall--and its worldwide consequences illustrate how deeply interconnected our planet's climate really is.

Use this interactive map to learn more about the El Niño Southern Oscillation and it's effects throughout history. Hover over each event to learn more, click on them to see more detailed information and use the buttons at the bottom of the map to filter the events.
