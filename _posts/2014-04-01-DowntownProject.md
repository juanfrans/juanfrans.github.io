*This project was created in collaboration with [Co-Office](http://www.co-office.co/).*

A short animation that visualizes public activity around Science City during the first six months of 2014. Based on wifi access data, this visualization charts the increasing number of people moving and working around downtown Vegas. Different panels measure the activity around each of Science City's venues and graphs chart the distribution of passersby, visitors and people who are actually connected to the network.
