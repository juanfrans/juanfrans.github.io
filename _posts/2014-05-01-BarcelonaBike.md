During the two months of the Barcelona Cycle Challenge 2014 thousands of bicycle rides were taken around the city. This animation visualizes all of those rides, compressing them into a single day, and illuminates the city's great biking activity, as well as the different patterns of biking that occur throughout the day. In addition, we keep track of how the different districts are doing compared to each other, tallying up their rides in the neighborhood competition.
